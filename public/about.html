<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am Aaron Lewis. I'm currently a student at St. Joseph Engineering College, where I'm pursuing a degree in 
  Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning. My academic journey has fueled a deep passion for 
  technology and innovation, driving me to explore various aspects of software development. I've 
  always been fascinated by how technology can solve real-world problems, which has led me to focus
   on building practical, user-friendly applications.</p>

<p>One of my key projects was developing an Inventory Management System as part of my coursework.
   This project involved creating a web-based application using PHP and MySQL to manage inventory 
   and product stock efficiently. I integrated features such as CRUD operations, real-time stock
    updates, and user authentication, all wrapped in a user-friendly interface designed with 
    Bootstrap 5 and jQuery. This experience not only honed my coding skills but also gave me 
    valuable insights into database management and the importance of clean, maintainable code.</p>

<p>Beyond my academic and project work, I'm continuously seeking opportunities to learn and grow
   in the tech field. I enjoy experimenting with new programming languages, exploring the latest 
   developments in AI and machine learning, and working on side projects that challenge my 
   creativity. I believe in the power of technology to make a positive impact, and I'm excited
    to contribute to this ever-evolving field.</p>
